# This playbook will install MariaDB and create db user and give permissions.
# we are installing using rh software collections just to be a 
# smart ass. This no longer requires extra work.
# The syspaths option deliberately installs shell wrappers
# into the regular path. This is OK, cuz we are only running 10.2
# and nothing else!
